🌐 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): A private, isolated network for all our resources.

🪣 S3 Bucket: A place to store your bitcoin_prices.xlsx file.

📦 ECR (Elastic Container Registry): A private Docker registry to hold your application's image.

🚀 ECS Fargate: The service that will run your container without you having to manage any servers.

 Application Load Balancer (ALB): A smart router to send internet traffic to your running application.


###what is VPC

Think of a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) ☁️ as your own private, fenced-off piece of land within the vast AWS cloud. It's a secure space where you can launch your resources.

To make our application work, we need a few basic things inside our VPC:

Public Subnets: These are like specific zones on our land that we want to be accessible from the outside world. Our load balancer and application will live here.

Internet Gateway: This is the main gate connecting our private land to the public internet. Without it, nothing gets in or out.

Route Table: This is a set of rules, like a GPS, that tells network traffic how to get from our subnets, through the Internet Gateway, and out to the internet.

We now have a complete, functional network foundation in the vpc.tf file. All the pieces are defined and connected:

A private network space (VPC) ☁️

A public area for our app (Subnet) 🏡

A door to the internet (Internet Gateway) 🚪

A map for traffic (Route Table) 🗺️

With the "land" and "roads" built, we can move on to the next two pieces which is:


Creating a private gallery to store our Docker image (ECR).

Creating a storage bucket for your bitcoin_prices.xlsx file (S3).
